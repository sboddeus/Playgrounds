 Congratulations on finishing Cipher!
 
 Now that you've proven yourself a substitution cipher savant, use this handy crypto-program to encrypt and decrypt your own messages!
 
 **Experiment:**
 
 1. Type anything you like into the top box.
 2. In the Shift box, enter a value.
 3. Copy your newly created ciphertext out of the bottom box and share it with your friends!
 
 **Tip:** To *decrypt* text, just tap Decrypt on the selector at the top of the page, type or paste your ciphertext into the top box, and enter the shift value.
 
When you're ready, you can [try another challenge](playgrounds://featured). Good luck!
