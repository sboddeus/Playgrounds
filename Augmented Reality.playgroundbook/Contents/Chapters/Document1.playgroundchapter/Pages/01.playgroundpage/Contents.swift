 Welcome, coder! A new adventure awaits youâ€”itâ€™s time to [augment](glossary://augment) your reality! ðŸ˜¯
 
 Today is an exciting day, because youâ€™re going to bring your pals from Learn to Code into your world! But before Byte & Friends can make the leap into your dimension, youâ€™ll have to get set up. So put on your coding cap and get ready!
 
 Before you write any code, think for a minute about the meaning of *augmented reality*. You look *through* your device and into the world, which is enhanced and augmented with digital objects.
 
 1. You look at your iPad screen.
 2. Your iPad looks at the world through its camera.
 3. The iPad uses data from its camera to get the location of surrounding objects.
 4. The iPad puts new, digital objects into the world.
 5. The iPad displays the fully formed augmented scene to you on its screen!
 
 **Try this:**
 
 Use the `enableCameraVision()` method below to see the world as your iPadâ€™s camera sees it.
